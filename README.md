Variables - in PHP these are represented by a dollar sign followed by the name of the variable. The variable name is case-sensitive. Example ($title)

Constant - is an identifier (name) for a simple value. As the name suggests, that value cannot change during the execution of the script (except for magic constants, which aren't actually constants). A constant is case-sensitive by default. By convention, constant identifiers are always uppercase.

Expressions - are constants and variables. When you type "$a = 5", you're assigning '5' into $a. 

Operator -  is something that takes one or more values (or expressions, in programming jargon) and yields another value (so that the construction itself becomes an expression).

Types of Operators
•	Operator Precedence
•	Arithmetic Operators
•	Assignment Operators
•	Bitwise Operators
•	Comparison Operators
•	Error Control Operators
•	Execution Operators
•	Incrementing/Decrementing Operators
•	Logical Operators
•	String Operators
•	Array Operators
•	Type Operators

Function - is a piece of code which takes one more input in the form of parameter and does some processing and returns a value.
Exceptions - can be thrown, and caught ("catched") within PHP. Code may be surrounded in a try block, to facilitate the catching of potential exceptions. Each try must have at least one corresponding catch or finally block.

$this- Reference to an object that is currently being used.

assertClassHasAttribute- Reports an error if class name / attribute name does not exist.

Expected- A value that a function should have.

Void- A method set to void will not return any value.

testVolvoAccelerate- This will test whether or not the Volvo class accelerate function is working correctly.

testVolvoDecelerate- This will test whether the Volvo class decelerate function is working correctly.

attributeName- The name of an aspect for a class.  For example, wheels is a name for an attribute of the car class. 
 
ClassName- This is declaring which class is being used.  An example would be in the function testCarHasWheels the className is pointing to which class the test should look to do the test.

Method_exists- This is checking whether a particular method in a class is there.
0bject- Is like noun it refers to a specific thing.

Test- A function in a test file that tests if a function in another part of a program is working as intended.
