Variables - in PHP these are represented by a dollar sign followed by the name of the variable. The variable name is case-sensitive. Example ($title)
Constant - is an identifier (name) for a simple value. As the name suggests, that value cannot change during the execution of the script (except for magic constants, which aren't actually constants). A constant is case-sensitive by default. By convention, constant identifiers are always uppercase.
Expressions - are constants and variables. When you type "$a = 5", you're assigning '5' into $a. 
Operator -  is something that takes one or more values (or expressions, in programming jargon) and yields another value (so that the construction itself becomes an expression).
Types of Operators
•	Operator Precedence
•	Arithmetic Operators
•	Assignment Operators
•	Bitwise Operators
•	Comparison Operators
•	Error Control Operators
•	Execution Operators
•	Incrementing/Decrementing Operators
•	Logical Operators
•	String Operators
•	Array Operators
•	Type Operators
Function - is a piece of code which takes one more input in the form of parameter and does some processing and returns a value.
Exceptions - can be thrown, and caught ("catched") within PHP. Code may be surrounded in a try block, to facilitate the catching of potential exceptions. Each try must have at least one corresponding catch or finally block.
